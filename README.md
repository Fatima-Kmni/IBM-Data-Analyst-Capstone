# IBM Data Analyst Capstone Project

This repo has my work for the IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate Capstone on Coursera.
It includes:
- Jupyter notebooks from Lab01 to Lab23, where I practiced collecting data, cleaning it, exploring, and making visualizations.  
- My final presentation (PDF and PowerPoint).  
- The survey datasets I used. They are not uploaded here because of size, but they are available from Coursera.
For this project I mainly worked with Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn), SQL, and IBM Cognos Analytics.  
The goal was to analyze data from the Stack Overflow Developer Survey and see what programming skills are most in demand. I cleaned and prepared the data, created visualizations and dashboards, and then built a presentation to share the findings.
Some of the main insights:
Python and SQL are leading programming languages, MySQL and PostgreSQL are common databases, Jupyter Notebook and VS Code are the most used IDEs, and cloud and AI-related skills are rising in importance.
This project was a good chance for me to bring together everything from the certificate: collecting, cleaning, analyzing, visualizing, and presenting data in a clear way.
Overall this project was a good way for me to practice what I learned and show how I can take a dataset from start to finish.
