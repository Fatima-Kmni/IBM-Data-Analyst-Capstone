# IBM Data Analyst Capstone Project

This repository has my work for the IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate Capstone Project on Coursera.  

Inside the repo:
- labs → all Jupyter notebooks from Lab01 to Lab23. They cover things like collecting data, cleaning it, exploratory analysis, and making visualizations.  
- final → my final presentation in PDF and PowerPoint format.  
- data → the survey datasets I worked with (not uploaded here because of the size, they are available from Coursera).  

Tools and methods I used:
Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn), SQL, IBM Cognos Analytics, plus data wrangling, visualization, and regression models.  

About the project:  
The goal was to explore data from the Stack Overflow Developer Survey and find what skills are most in demand. I cleaned and analyzed the data, built charts and dashboards, and then put together a presentation to share the results.  

Some main points I found:  
- Python and SQL are the top programming languages.  
- MySQL and PostgreSQL are the most used databases.  
- Jupyter Notebook and VS Code are the most common IDEs.  
- Cloud and AI-related skills are becoming more important.  

This project brought together everything I practiced in the certificate: collecting, cleaning, analyzing, visualizing, and presenting data.
